				After meeting many IDs, we decided to engage Victor. We feel comfortable working with Victor because of his patience and professionalism. Our requests constantly change throughout the entire renovation process and he was able to provide constructive advice. He was very patient and brought us to choose the tiles multiple times as we were indecisive in our decision. Highly recommended Victor for going the extra mile in ensuring that we can have our current dream home!

				We are first time home owners and were actually anxious and worried in the beginning as we did not know where to start. However our ID, Victor, has made the whole process very pleasant since our first discussion with him. He has an eye for detail and understands our wants and needs very well. Last and most importantly there is trust and honesty between us. We will definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a fuss free way to a beautiful cosy home.

				After the renovation, the was a design fault. The drawer is unable to open fully as it's path is block by the door handle. Victor immediately consider and instructed to redesign and remake the drawer. And this is without any request on my side. Victor/Roy also propose a few designs, but to my liking I have asked him to change. They revise the 3D drawings, and the discussion were smooth and easy to work with. After <br>staying for over a year, the built is still good.

				Visited many design companies, found Victor and will say that it's our best decision made. Patient and open to our demands, not pushy and honest in opinion. Thorough in his follow up and prompt in replies through the entire renovation and planning process. Provided professional advice and was willing to listen effectively to our wants and needs. Even went the extra mile to offer advice in many other selection process and was personal in service. Bringing us to vendors he had worked with and I will say it was a very pleasant experience, surpassing our expectations. Workmanship is detailed and of good quality. Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a no hidden frills designer who is willing to go the extra mile in ensuring you have a home personalised in your preference of design and needs.

				When it comes to spending, especially when it involves substantial amount of money, I am particularly stringent about it. We shortlisted a handful of IDs by filtering the reviews and ratings using the Qanvast app which was very useful and efficient.
				An appointment was set and we met Victor on the 24 Feb (Sat) at 1130 hrs. Upon reaching his office, we were promptly greeted by his smile. Our similar age group, his bubbly personality and same lingo connected Victor and us seamlessly. To be honest, my wife is a very shy person but Victor made her less reserved and she was also able to discuss with him about her ideas on the kitchen layout and etc.
				Victor had already printed our HDB layout plan well before we came. Before we proceeded to discuss, he asked us what we wanted to drink as it was really<span id="reviews1__dots">...</span><span id="reviews1__more"> a hot day. He gave us the drinks from the fridge before we started the discussion which was a nice gesture.
				Victor is in fact a very good listener, attentive to small details and what we like about him is his candidness (i.e. frankness). He would listen to all our crazy ideas and would point out the peculiarities and concerns that he had. He would also tell us if an idea was practical as we itinerated that we wanted a simple and airy home that doesn’t have any platforms/spaces that could easily trap dust.
				After the fruitful discussion which lasted for 1.5 hrs, we insisted on a verbal quotation and was verbally quoted an X figure amount. This amount didn’t flinch much from the final quotation when we received it - which was great! Victor sent us the furnished quotation in a few days’ time for our perusal. There were minimal mistakes in it and we were glad that it conform within our initial budget.
				As we were in the midst of comparing with other IDs that we chose initially, we found that not only did the quotation by Victor suited our budget, we found that we could communicate with him better as he wasn’t as imposing unlike the other IDS and as I have mentioned previously, he isn’t pushy and a very good listener.
				Fast forward to Nov 2018, we finally moved into our new HDB flat. Thank God, whatever that we have envisioned of a simple and airy home came to fruition! Although the final renovation cost was a little bit higher (partly due to our fault as we requested for additional items), we were blessed to have Victor as our ID.
				Thank you Victor for making our dream home a reality! :)</span>

				Victor is someone who can be trusted to help you design and manage your renovation. I remember when I first got the keys to my resale flat home, it was in a rather bad condition in my opinion. The previous owner had their own flavour of renovation but unfortunately it wasn't to our liking. We seek out Victor to be our interior designer and we have not regretted our decision since. We met up multiple times and discussed how we wanted our new home to be. He gave his honest opinion and also gave his fair shares of idea of how to make our dream home a reality. We opted for a Scandinavian theme home and Victor shared with us many examples of possible ideas to be done. He even brought us to various shops to look for tiles and such. The time and effort he put into our project was commendable.<span id="reviews2__dots">...</span><span id="reviews2__more"> When the renovation started, I had full confidence that Victor would do a fantastic job and it was exactly what it was. Because of my tight schedule of my personal time and the moving out of my previous home, we had to give Victor the stress to finish up the project before Chinese New Year in 2018 when he only managed to start the renovation in late December. During the time of the renovation, he constantly kept me in the loop of what is going on and what is the progress of the renovation. Our constant communication was what gave me full confidence that ultimately the project would be a success. To cut the long story short, Victor delivered on time and we managed to moved in 2 days before the Chinese New Year. For anyone who is thinking of engaging Victor to be your ID, you can rest assure that you are in good hands and know that this ID is someone who gives his utmost best when handling your project. I am now happily living in my dream home and it gives me much pleasure to be at home with my family. We are delighted to call this beautiful place home for the years to come, thanks to Victor. </span><button onclick="myFunction(2)" id="reviews2__btn">Read more</button></p>

				ID Victor was responsive to our queries and concerns during our renovation period. Things that were done incorrectly, he will make sure his workers re-do again which was the right things to do. ID also has good after-sales services/follow-up. Issues cropped up some months after the renovation, he was willing to rectify them. Very good and responsible ID. An enthusiastic ID. Can be trusted. Thank you victor !

				Victor is patient throughout the entire project, even though we gave him very challenging requirements. He is also a good listener who makes sure the owners’ ideas and opinions are heard and taken into considerations. That said, he does not blindly follow all of them, and will not hesitate to propose alternatives which can cater to individual’s needs, from cost-savings solutions to very unique ideas. Worksmanship<span id="reviews3__dots">...</span><span id="reviews3__more"> is generally good, hence there were minimal rectification works required after handing over. Victor’s problem solving skills are really commendable, even when we intercept halfway during the project with new ideas or change of plans. Although there were some delays in the timeline which we thought is typically unavoidable, we would still strongly recommend Step Dezign Pte Ltd to work on your dream home!</span><button onclick="myFunction(3)" id="reviews3__btn">Read more</button></p>
