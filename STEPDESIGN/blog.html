    	<h2>Is minimalism really worth it?</h2>
    	<p>Minimalism is quite a straightforward design theme when you think about it. 
			Have you ever wondered why does minimalism costs as much as any other design? 
			The name speaks for itself, minimal. Your first impression of minimalism would probably be that there is 
			'minimal' design, and there must have come a time where you might have thought, "Hey, I could do that." Well, 
			that is just half the story. Minimalism does indeed look empty, but there is a reason behind it. Minimalism caters 
			to avoid triggers or distractions within the space. It is the design that highlights what is essential and eliminates 
			what is not. It focuses primarily on function, and within function comes design.</p>
			<p>This article is a short introduction to the general idea of what minimalism really stands for and what interior 
				designers go through to get an ideal design scheme for you.
			</p>
			<br>
			<div class="blog__img">
				<div class="center"><img src="assets/images/blogs/1/bg2.jpg"></div>
			  </div>
			  <h3>So what is minimalism all really about</h3>
			  <p>The idea of minimalism has lasted for decades and will continue to do so in the coming years. It is one of the most basic forms 
				  of design, and yet many variables can be applied as minimalism. Think of it as a telescope. This movement allows designers to 
				  express content more in-depth by focusing all of the elements towards that one direction. This design theme brings out the value
				   within a space, whether big or small. The intention is to devoid our vision from unnecessary objects and to put our attention 
				   into things that matter, things that bring value into your overall space. Apart from anything, it also considered a lifestyle. 
				   Yes, minimalism may not be for everyone, but it is up to you to decide. Some people rest comfortably in a place of contrast, 
				   while others would prefer a place of simplicity. However, it is meant to give a calming sensation, to provide the mind with 
				   some space and most importantly, to make you look forward to returning to the place each day.
				Simplicity is such a colossal concept, there is much Japanese influence towards designers, and it influences a designer's spatial thoughts.
				</p>

			  <h3>Characteristics of Minimalism</h3>
			  <p>Neutral colors are mainly used in these types of schemes. Colors affect your mood. Cooler colors give a calmer atmosphere but can also be interpreted as bold and harmony. While the red spectrum gives a more warm and comforting feeling, but red can also represent romance and passion. These colors have a variable impact on the surrounding, depending on how it is being used. 
				In this case, a neutral color palette is considered a safe option. The main feature of the design would typically be based on white and other colors such as grey and beige will perform as accent colors to help elevate the space.
				</p>

					<div class="center"><img src="assets/images/blogs/1/bg4.jpg"></div>
				  </div>
				  <h3>Respecting the "Space"</h3>
				  <p>When you properly look at the minimalist design, you will notice that there is a more profound quality in the design. 
					  When you take away different sources of elemental clutter and make use of structural models in their purest forms, 
					  you then allow more space to remain, and that is the beauty of it.</p>
				  <h3>Is there a problem with minimalism?</h3>
				  <p>Definitely. This becomes a problem when people have a misunderstanding with the idea of this theme. Minimalism is a design,
					   not the absence of it. It indeed makes use of variations of negative spacing, but this is intended to help the viewer keep 
					   the focus on the contents that the design is trying to emphasize. The point of having a minimalistic interior is to have a 
					   clutter-free environment. That means there is a requirement for a lifestyle adjustment. The minimalist interior will have 
					   its aesthetic sense when it is left as it is. When you add something new overtime as simple as a new shelf, it becomes an 
					   additional element that eventually becomes a distraction.</p>
					   <h3>So the big question, is it? Is minimalism worth paying for?</h3>
					   <p>Designers cater to people with busy schedules via minimalistic approaches. People want to see an easy to clean and tidy 
						   place after a long day of work, where no more stress would come in part of managing the household in terms of intricate 
						   designs. Having a great design won't make the house as safe; neither does the absence of design. That is where interior 
						   designers come. They advocate the needs of the space rather than apply a design theme. Every site has different specifics 
						   that work well with some topics and don't with others. Whether you consider minimalism to be a design, it certainly does
							have its aesthetic sense. How does your home make you feel? Your home is your exclusive retreat from a long day of work. 
							It is something that you can control, something that can improve your life.</p>
							<h3>Why Interior Designers?</h3>
							<p>You know when you see something interesting and think "Oh that would look good in my place" and you considered buying it, and then later you realize that it doesn't look as good as you thought it did. Well, you are not the only one. When you hire an interior designer, they don't just make your house beautiful. They go through a couple of stages before they conclude with design proposals that would specifically suit you and your home. </p>
							<p>Designers visualize what your space will eventually look like and narrow down what type of materials will be used following the design. Then comes the space-planning where objects and structures are plotted in with regards to your site, making sure that every inch of that space is being used suit its primary functions while having a balance of aesthetic flare. Lastly comes the quotation where the overall design and theme are estimated to cost. </p>

							  <p>This is where you can save yourself from making any costly mistakes. These people are professionally trained  to use  materials and furnitures of high quality in order to meet design expectations. Apart from conceptualizing and choosing materials, a designers job is to get to know you, connect, inspire and gain your trust, catering a custom design just for you. If it feels right for you then you can enjoy having the workload taken out of your hands.</p>
